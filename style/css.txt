This is how we do stylesheet

the stylesheet class name has these parts:

    function_align_border

function may include font and size.  some functions such as "table"
would not contain font and size.

align is the vertical or horizontal alignment, or the combination of
both, in the order listed.

border can be "b" or blank for no border.
